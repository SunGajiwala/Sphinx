Overview
========

**This is the code functionality documentation from the Analytics team for the ADMISSION DECISION MAKING APPLICATION.**

#. We have done some data preprocessing which is added to the preprocessing team `repo <https://github.com/DSCI-Admissions-project/data-processing/blob/main/Data%20Preprocessing%20Updated.ipynb>`_ and some analysis in (Preliminary Data Analysis.ipynb).

#. Feature Engineering (Feature Engineering.ipynb)

#. Feature Selection (Feature Selection.ipynb)

#. As requested, the data preprocessing and feature engineering codes have been merged together in Data Preprocessing `Repo <https://github.com/DSCI-Admissions-project/data-processing/blob/main/Data%20Preprocessing%20Updated.ipynb>`_ for the one-step input to ML team.

#. The Power BI dashboard is using the data generated by that notebook.

#. The csv file for the feature importance by different terms and programs have been added in the NAS server and it is given by (Feature Importance by Term.ipynb)

**To do:**

#. Add PowerBI component for the feature importance by different terms to show the changing features according to different terms and Programs.
